Got this Cricket data from here: http://bigplusflag.pythonanywhere.com/sql. 

Thanks to reddit user  /u/mellowyellow6491 for updating and maintaining it.Also thanks to reddit user /u/SepulchreOfAzrael for adding the Bowling lists.

Goal: I am still trying to make some sense of all this data.Might end up making some visualizations.
